# Module-05_PyBer-with-Matplotlib
## Project overview

This challenge is meant to summarize and analyze ride data for decision makers at PyBer. The compiled data provided is in two different datasets:

* First: city_data.csv lists the number of drivers that services cities in three area types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.
* Second: ride_data.csv is more detailed and provides metrics into the dates on which the rides took place and the rates from which cities charged to customers.

## Analysis
![Rides and Fares by City Types ](https://github.com/ZacharyPascalar/Module-05_PyBer-with-Matplotlib/blob/main/Dataframe%20-%20PyBer.png)
![Total Far by City Type](https://github.com/ZacharyPascalar/Module-05_PyBer-with-Matplotlib/blob/main/Total%20Fare%20by%20City%20Type.png)

Since the two data sets intersect -via city field- we simply merged them and extrapolated information such as:

* total rides by areas;
* number of drivers the three (3) areas identified earlier;
* the total amount of fares PyBer has collected in these areas. 60% of Pyber's revenue comes from rides in urban areas banking $39,854 (see Attchement 1). There is potential in other areas if they were to decrease their fares in the in the suburban and rural areas. PyBer's services are relevant in urban and suburban cities. A campaign targeting these areas with fares that appeal to both drivers and customers could be profitable. Attachment 1 shows revenue and rides per areas. Given more time we could run a model in which we experimented with fares and showcase the revenues they could have generated.

## Recommendations to CEO

We would recommend to PyBer's CEO:

First, start by tracking the distance (mileage) covered by drivers, and determine a rate that would expand the customer base. Second, if polling suggests rural and suburban areas may expand, it would be a good idea to create a reward system to offer incentives to customers.
Third, increase the number of drivers in the city and make Pyber readily available to customers. The attached graph shows the suburban rides show a considerable spike in May and has the potential to offer as much business as the urban market Attachment 2 Total Fare by City Type.
